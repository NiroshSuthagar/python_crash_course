# Python Sets & Dictionaries: Practice Worksheet

This worksheet provides practice exercises for Python sets and dictionaries. The questions are categorized into Easy, Medium, and Hard to help you build your skills progressively.

## Part 1: Python Sets

### 🧊 Easy Questions

**1. Create a Set:** Create a set named `fruits` containing the following items: "apple", "banana", "cherry". Print the set.

**2. Add an Item:** Start with the set `fruits = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}`. Add "orange" to the set. Print the updated set.

**3. Remove an Item:** Using the set from the previous question, remove "banana". Print the updated set.

**4. Check for an Item:** Given the set `colors = {"red", "green", "blue"}`, write code to check if "green" is present in the set and print the result (True/False).

### 🔥 Medium Questions

**1. Set Union:** Given two sets, `set_a = {1, 2, 3, 4}` and `set_b = {3, 4, 5, 6}`, find the union of the two sets and print the result.

**2. Set Intersection:** Using the same sets from the previous question (`set_a` and `set_b`), find their intersection and print the result.

**3. Set Difference:** Find the elements that are in `set_a` but not in `set_b`. Print the result.

**4. Symmetric Difference:** Find the elements that are in either `set_a` or `set_b` but not in both. Print the result.

**5. Remove Duplicates from a List:** You are given a list with duplicate values: `numbers = [10, 20, 30, 20, 10, 50, 60, 40, 80, 50, 40]`. Use a set to remove the duplicates and then convert it back into a list. Print the final list.

### 🌶️ Hard Questions

**1. Subset Check:** You have three sets: `a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}` `b = {2, 3}` `c = {2, 6}` Write code to check if `b` is a subset of `a`. Then, check if `c` is a subset of `a`. Print the results.

**2. Find Missing Numbers:** You have a set of consecutive numbers from 1 to 10: `full_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}`. You are given another set `partial_set = {2, 5, 8, 1}`. Find and print the numbers that are missing from `partial_set`.

**3. Unique Common Elements:** Given three lists of words, find the words that are common to all three lists, ensuring that the final result contains no duplicates. `list1 = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]` `list2 = ["banana", "date", "fig", "grape"]` `list3 = ["cherry", "date", "banana", "elderberry"]` Print the set of common words.
